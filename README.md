# 🚀 GARUDA - Next-Generation Digital Forensics and Incident Response Toolkit

GARUDA is a modular, AI-enhanced, and distributed digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) framework designed to streamline investigations across modern computing environments — including cloud platforms, IoT devices, and blockchain systems.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

GARUDA provides investigators with an extensible platform to handle the complete forensic lifecycle:  
- Evidence Acquisition  
- Data Processing  
- Artifact Analysis  
- Investigation Reporting

It integrates AI/ML for intelligent anomaly detection, NLP for text-based evidence mining, and automation playbooks for accelerated response actions — all while maintaining forensic integrity through strong encryption and audit trail mechanisms.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🔍 **Data Acquisition**: Remote memory capture, disk imaging, network traffic collection, and cloud artifact extraction.  
- 🧹 **Evidence Processing**: Normalization, metadata extraction, parsing of system, network, and application artifacts.  
- 📊 **Analysis Tools**: Timeline reconstruction, anomaly detection, file carving, correlation engines, and interactive dashboards.  
- 📝 **Reporting Module**: Auto-generation of detailed forensic reports and customizable visualizations for investigations.  
- 🔐 **Security**: Full encryption for data at rest and in transit; blockchain-ready audit trails for tamper-proof evidence tracking.  
- 🤖 **AI/NLP Integration**: Automated artifact prioritization, malware behavior analysis, and natural language search over forensic datasets.  
- 🌐 **Deployment Flexibility**: CLI-based automation tools and a safe web-based GUI for users with varying technical expertise.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

- **Distributed Environment**: Scalable architecture for on-premise, hybrid, and cloud deployments.  
- **Modular Design**: Each component (Acquisition, Processing, Analysis, Reporting) can function independently or in tandem.  
- **Extensible**: Easy integration with external threat intelligence sources (MISP, VirusTotal, Shodan).
